# Small-language-model-with-compression
PPM (Prediction by Partial Matching) and similar methods are statistical models used for text compression and generation. They work by predicting the next character or symbol in a sequence based on the context.

# PPM and Similar Models
PPM models maintain a table of probabilities for the next symbol given a certain context (a sequence of preceding symbols). The model generates text by iteratively predicting and outputting symbols based on these probabilities.
That's very different from Markov Chain text generation, where the prediction of the next state is independent of the context. 

# PPM models use a combination of two techniques:
Context Modeling: They build a model of the probability distribution of symbols given a context.
Arithmetic Coding: They use arithmetic coding to encode the generated text into a compact binary representation.

PPM models can achieve good compression ratios and are more suitable for resource-constrained environments compared to architectures based on Transformers, which use complex mathematical operations.

Yet, PPM models have a limited ability to understand long-range dependencies and complex contexts, and they can require a significant amount of training data to achieve good performance, which indeed requires a lot of memory.

# Comparison with Markov Chain Text Generation
As mentioned earlier, Markov chain text generation predicts the next word or symbol based on the n previous words. The model is simple and works well for certain types of text, but it can produce repetitive or bland text.

# Comparison with Transformers-based Text Generation
Transformers are powerful models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks, including text generation. They understand complex contexts and can produce coherent and engaging text.
